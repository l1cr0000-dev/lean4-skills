# Changelog

## v4.8.6 (September 2026)

Local-instance guidance corrected for Lean 4 (#188) and the obsolete trimmed-measure idiom removed (#162). Documentation and contract check only.

### Fixed

- **`have`/`let` are the default for local instances; `haveI`/`letI` differ only by inlining.** The skill recommended `haveI`/`letI` as the way to create local typeclass instances — correct in Lean 3, wrong in Lean 4, where `have` and `let` already register a class-typed local for synthesis (verified on Lean 4.33.1 in tactic and term mode). In a tactic proof of a proposition the inlining can have no effect (proof irrelevance), so `haveI`/`letI` are never needed there and Mathlib's [`haveI`/`letI` linter](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Tactic/Linter/HaveILetI.html) flags them; `letI` is reserved for definitions where the instance *value* must be inlined into data. SKILL.md's Type Class Patterns states the rule with the linter link and a "check whether synthesis already succeeds" step; every proof-context example that prescribed `haveI`/`letI` (compilation-errors, instance-pollution, measure-theory, domain-patterns, compiler-guided-repair, tactic-patterns, agent-workflows, command-examples, review, cycle-engine, proof-repair) now uses `have`/`let`. instance-pollution.md's "use plain `let` for data" fix was itself a Lean-3-ism — plain `let` registers a class-typed local just as `letI` does — and now says pollution comes from the extra class-typed local, not the keyword.
- **`isFiniteMeasure_trim μ hm` / `sigmaFinite_trim μ hm` removed (#162).** `IsFiniteMeasure (μ.trim hm)` is a Mathlib `instance` now (`isFiniteMeasure_trim`, with `μ` implicit — the old term would not even typecheck), `SigmaFinite (μ.trim hm)` follows from it via `IsFiniteMeasure.toSigmaFinite`, and no plain `sigmaFinite_trim` exists in `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Measure.Trim` any more. measure-theory.md, domain-patterns.md, and compilation-errors.md drop both `IsFiniteMeasure` declarations, keep the σ-finiteness freeze as the optional `have : SigmaFinite (μ.trim hm) := inferInstance`, and lead with the general rule: check whether synthesis already succeeds before adding a local instance. Check 41 pins the SKILL.md rule, rejects any `haveI`/`letI` example line in the touched references, rejects the two stale trim idioms repo-wide, and requires the synthesis-first wording.
- **Reference audit for further Lean-3-isms and stale Mathlib names.** A fingerprint sweep of every reference, command, and agent doc (Lean 3 tactic names, `begin…end`, comma lambdas, lowercase namespaces, snake_case class names, `split` on conjunctions, `refine'`, `∑ x in s`, renamed lemmas) found: `apply_instance` ×3 (compilation-errors, tactics-reference) → `infer_instance`; measure-theory.md's `set_integral_condexp` / `integrable_condexp` / `stronglyMeasurable_condexp` / `aestronglyMeasurable_condexp` → the 2024 `setIntegral_condExp` / `…_condExp` names (verified in current Mathlib); tactic-patterns.md's `condExp_unique`, which does not exist → `ae_eq_condExp_of_forall_setIntegral_eq`; its `intros` entries → named `intro` (Lean 4's `intros` yields inaccessible names); and a lemma list still naming the removed `sigmaFinite_trim`. Everything else the sweep flagged was prose or already Lean 4. Check 41 rejects `apply_instance` and the pre-rename spellings repo-wide.
- **Review round: compile-checked corrections.** Every changed snippet was then elaborated against a Mathlib checkout (`tests/fixtures/reference_snippets/measure_theory_snippets.lean`, run manually with `lake env lean` from a Mathlib project; CI has no Mathlib). That caught: `aestronglyMeasurable_condExp` does not exist — the form is `stronglyMeasurable_condExp.aestronglyMeasurable`; the set-integral wrapper's `hm : m ≤ ‹_›` resolves to `m ≤ m` (the very trap the file warns about) — it now names the ambient space, states `hs : MeasurableSet[m] s`, and takes `[IsFiniteMeasure μ]`; the pushforward example is `Measure.isProbabilityMeasure_map hf` (the probability assumption is an instance argument) and its `((μ.map f : Measure β) : Type)` ascription is gone; `swap n` / bare `rotate` (lean-phrasebook) → `pick_goal n` / `rotate_left n`; `termination_by my_rec n => n` (pre-4.6) → `termination_by n`. Two conceptual corrections: the "missing instance" recipes (review, command-examples, compiler-guided-repair, agent-workflows, cycle-engine, tactic-patterns) no longer prescribe `have : C := inferInstance` — which re-runs the failed search — but distinguish making an existing instance visible, supplying a value/proof, and freezing one that already synthesizes; and the compilation-errors "maximum recursion depth" row/section now separates `maxRecDepth` (elaboration recursion) from `synthInstance.maxHeartbeats` (instance search). The measure-theory "`inferInstance` drift trap" no longer claims an elaborated value mutates: later class-typed locals change what *later* elaboration picks. Check 41 pins the compile-checked forms and rejects the broken ones. Round 3: the repair recipes' supplied values are qualified — `borel β` only given `[TopologicalSpace β]` and when Borel is the intended σ-algebra, and the agent-workflows `DiscreteTopology` repair now cites its evidence (`hdisc : t = ⊥`; `⟨rfl⟩` proves it only when the topology literally is `⊥`, and measurability never establishes discreteness) — both added to the compile-check fixture; a deliberate data-definition `letI` example is allowed by a `-- data:` marker in Check 41.
- **Review round 4: `comap` direction, the σ-algebra-relations block, drift-trap wording, and CI-checked evidence.** `MeasurableSpace.comap Z m` pulls the *codomain* structure back along `Z : Ω → β`, so the documented `comap Z m0` / `comap W m0` (with `m0 : MeasurableSpace Ω`, the domain) was a type error; instance-pollution.md's TL;DR and Solution 2 and measure-theory.md's quick fix and advanced example now use `comap Z mβ` / `comap W mγ`, with the joint σ-algebra as `comap (fun ω ↦ (Z ω, W ω)) (mβ.prod mγ)`. The ready-to-paste σ-Algebra Relations block is replaced by a compile-checked one: named ambient structures instead of `‹MeasurableSpace Ω›`, `Measurable.prodMk` (not `prod_mk`), `MeasurableSpace.comap_le_comap_of_eq_comp Prod.snd measurable_snd rfl` for σ(W) ≤ σ(Z,W) (the old `(measurable_snd.comp …).comap_le` proved a bound against the *ambient* space), and the transport line names `StronglyMeasurable[mΩ]` — with the two `let`s in scope a bare `StronglyMeasurable` resolves to the newest local and `.mono` fails, which the fixture now demonstrates. Drift-trap wording made consistent (no "drifts from ambient parameters", no categorical "never use `set`"; the rule is: name the ambient instance in the declaration, state ambient facts against it, and treat `let m0 := ‹…›` as the recovery when the signature is not yours). The "typeclass instance problem is stuck" hint now says what it is — unresolved metavariables in the class arguments, fixed by annotations/implicits, not a missing instance — and the timeout row's `have := ⟨proof⟩` states its type. Trim summaries say `[IsFiniteMeasure μ]` explicitly; `[SigmaFinite μ]` alone does not synthesize `SigmaFinite (μ.trim hm)` (`sigmaFinite_trim_bot_iff`), and the fixture has that as an executable `#guard_msgs` negative control alongside the `⟨rfl⟩` and wrong-direction-`comap` ones. New `tests/fixtures/reference_snippets/core_instance_snippets.lean` (core Lean, no Mathlib) shows a downstream consumer synthesizing a `have`- and `let`-supplied instance, plus `#guard_msgs` controls for no instance, the circular `:= inferInstance` recipe, and the statement-before-proof probe mistake; the `lean-integration` workflow runs it with the pinned toolchain. The Mathlib fixture records the exact commit it was checked against. Check 41 pins the codomain-`comap` forms, rejects the round-4 forms, and requires the core fixture and its CI step; its `borel` prerequisite rule accepts the topology mention on an adjacent line. Round 5: with `m0` a declaration parameter, `simpa [m0] using hZ` is rejected ("Variable `m0` is not a proposition or let-declaration") — the Solution 2 line is `hZ` directly and the three-tier ambient fact is `MeasurableSet[m0] (Z ⁻¹' B) := hBpre_m0` (a bare `MeasurableSet` selects the newest local); both forms and the rejected one are in the fixture. `‹MeasurableSpace Ω›` recovery wording now says it picks the currently selected local, so it must come first.

## v4.8.5 (September 2026)

Routing correction for `/lean4:golf`'s escalation (#55). Documentation and contract check only.

### Fixed

- **Golf no longer hands "statement changes or multi-file refactor" to the axiom-eliminator agent.** That agent is axiom/assumption hygiene only, but three golf-side handoff lines (`golf.md`, `agents/proof-golfer.md`, `references/proof-golfing.md` ×2) used it as a generic "bigger surgery" target. The routing is now: a candidate that would need a **statement change** is rejected and the proposed change reported for explicit approval, never applied (golf and `/lean4:refactor` both keep statements fixed; an unsuitable candidate is not evidence the statement is wrong, so the agent hands the decision back with `next_action = stop`, never `redraft`); a **multi-file or strategy-level refactor** — helper extraction, moving declarations between files, a different proof approach — hands off to `/lean4:refactor` by returning the proposal to the parent (the golfer never expands its file ownership); axiom-eliminator is used **only** for axiom/assumption hygiene. `refactor.md` now states it is golf's escalation target, and its Verify step uses the dependency-aware `lake lean <file>` gate so a cross-file batch cannot false-fail against a stale `.olean`. Check 40 pins per-file routing anchors, per-line consistency at every duplicated site (each multi-file line names `/lean4:refactor`, each axiom-eliminator handoff is restricted to hygiene), the `stop`-not-`redraft` signal, and rejects the old formulation.

## v4.8.4 (September 2026)

Hardening for the review-output validator's schema loader (#189, the post-#187 follow-up). Trusted-installation edge case; no behavior change for a valid schema.

### Fixed

- **`lean4-skills-validate-review-output` exits 4 cleanly on ill-typed schema machinery instead of tracebacking.** A schema with the correct identity but a wrong-typed keyword *value* — `"properties": []`, `"allOf": null`, `"items": 3`, `"required": "version"`, … — previously escaped the identity/keyword guards as an `AttributeError`/`TypeError` (exit 1 with a traceback). (`"$defs": "x"` already exited 4 via the identity check; it now reports the precise reason.) `load_output_schema` now runs a recursive keyword-value type check (`properties`/`$defs` objects; `allOf` list; `items`/`if`/`then`/`else` objects; `additionalProperties` bool-or-object; `enum` list; `required` list of strings; `type` a JSON type name or list; `$ref` a `#/$defs/…` string; `minimum` a number) before the identity check, and any residual `AttributeError`/`TypeError`/`KeyError`/`ValueError` raised while inspecting the parsed schema is mapped to `SchemaUnavailableError` (exit 4). Tests: unit cases over nine root and nested mutations, wrapper-level fixtures for `properties: []`, `allOf: null`, and a nested `items: 3` asserting exit 4 with no traceback, and a check that the shipped schema still loads.

## v4.8.3 (September 2026)

Verification-soundness correction for the per-file compile gate (#166). Documentation and contract check only; no runtime code.

### Fixed

- **`lake env lean File.lean` is documented as a built-imports-only check, not an unconditional verification gate.** It elaborates the file against the `.olean`s already built for its imports and never rebuilds an import, so after editing an imported module it can report a **false pass** (old `.olean` still satisfies the file) or a **false failure** (import fixed in source, `.olean` stale). Reproduced both directions on Lean 4.33.1 / Lake 5.0.0 with the two-module example from #166. New canonical **File Gate Scope** section under cycle-engine.md's Build Target Policy states the rule and the two recovery paths: rebuild every changed imported module then rerun the file gate, or run `lake lean <path/to/File.lean>` for the importing target (the dependency-aware file gate: builds the imports, then elaborates that exact file; `lake build <path/to/File.lean>` remains the optional module build; final verification may still need the project/checkpoint target). The two sites #166 cited (`sorry-filling.md` Step 3, `lean-lsp-server.md`) now carry the caveat; the verification-ladder mirrors (SKILL.md, command-examples.md) gain a clause; the cross-file editors (sorry-filler-deep, axiom-eliminator, proof-refactoring, sorry-filling deep mode) link to it and route post-cross-file-edit gating to `lake lean <path/to/File.lean>`; both agents' quick references now list `lake lean path/to/File.lean` beside the project-wide `lake build`. **`/lean4:disprove` certification no longer rests on the file gate:** the Prime Directive (command + engine), the Phase 3 compile gate (now unconditional, and repeated on the wrapper-free file before commit), the safety invariant, and the model-mediated pressure fixture all license `REFUTED` via `lake lean <target-file>` — it builds the file's imports, elaborates that exact file, accepts a target outside any `lean_lib` (where a targeted `lake build` is `unknown target`), and does not write the target's `.olean` (so a source rollback after a failed axiom gate leaves no stale artifact, which a targeted `lake build` would). `lake env lean` is demoted to a pre-screen, since a source/`.olean` mismatch that predates the run would otherwise certify a refutation against a stale import. The **axiom gate runs in that same `lake lean` process**: every shape appends a gate-only `#print axioms <¬TARGET decl>` block (unqualified, so it names the just-appended declaration even inside a namespace left open to end-of-file — `_root_.` would inspect an imported root declaration of the same name) under the transaction, the axiom set is read from that run's output, and the gate blocks are dropped and the file re-gated before commit (the transaction tool's docstring and a new `test_disprove_artifact_txn.sh` case cover command blocks, not only declarations; that test suite is now run by CI's `release-contract` job). `lean_verify` is advisory only — it elaborates a scratch copy through the persistent LSP, whose import snapshot can lag the rebuilt imports (an imported proof can switch to `sorryAx` with its type unchanged), so it must not license `REFUTED` on its own. Fast file-local uses elsewhere are unchanged. The old "`lake build` does not accept file path arguments" claim is corrected: current Lake (verified with Lean 4.33.1; not every Lake reporting 5.0.0) accepts a source path (resolving the module via the workspace config) and `+Pkg.Module`; what fails is a path that does not resolve under a lib's `srcDir` (e.g. the bare basename of a nested file) or a module name derived by textually turning `/` into `.` (wrong under a custom `srcDir`). The lint_docs rule that flagged every `lake build <path>.lean` (it enforced the false claim, and a regex cannot know whether a basename resolves under the lib's `srcDir`) is removed; Check 39 pins the actual false claims. The two `/lean4:disprove` worked examples in command-examples.md now show `lake lean <target-file>` as the compile gate before `REFUTED`. `lake lean <file>` is the generally valid dependency-aware file gate (any `.lean` file in the workspace) and `lake build <path>` the optional module build. Verified on Lake 5.0.0 including a custom-`srcDir` project. Check 39 pins the canonical section (both directions, both paths, no universal "sound check" claim), rejects the two old unqualified formulations, requires the links and `lake lean` lines on the highest-risk editors, and pins the disprove license (Prime Directives via `lake lean`, never a targeted `lake build`; unconditional Phase 3 gate + post-drop re-gate; safety invariant, and the pressure fixture's old "only `lake env lean` licenses" sentence must not return) — deliberately not on every mention.

## v4.8.2 (September 2026)

Latency follow-up for the Bash guardrail hook on hosts without `jq` (#193, the third item requested in #164; #164 itself stays open pending the reporter's Windows check of the v4.8.1 correctness fix).

### Changed

- **`guardrails.sh` starts `python3` once per guarded call when `jq` is absent, not twice.** The no-`jq` fallback (common on Windows/Git-Bash) previously ran one interpreter to extract `.tool_input.command` and a second for the working directory (`.cwd` → `.tool_input.cwd` → `.tool_input.workdir`), doubling interpreter-startup latency on every guarded Bash call. It now parses both in a single `python3` invocation using line-count-prefixed framing (`<N>`, then the cwd spanning N lines, then the possibly multi-line command) and splits in the shell, so even a cwd containing newlines round-trips exactly. The frame is read and written as raw UTF-8 bytes, so a native Windows CPython (whose text-mode stdout turns LF into CRLF) can no longer corrupt the fields; the old two-call path also left a trailing CR on the cwd on such hosts, which silently defeated Lean-project detection. Behavior is otherwise identical: multi-line commands still enforce, an empty command still allows, malformed JSON still fails open (allows), and the `jq` fast path is unchanged. Bash 3.2-safe; no new dependencies. New regression tests exercise the fallback with `jq` scrubbed from `PATH` and a counting `python3` shim that pins the startup count at one, plus a newline-in-path Lean project enforced on both the `jq` and no-`jq` paths, and a CRLF-translating `python3` shim (simulated native Windows stdout) that must still enforce with one startup.

## v4.8.1 (September 2026)

Reliability fix for the Bash guardrail hook on Windows/Git-Bash (the #164 wedge; the latency optimization #164 also requested is tracked as follow-up #193).

### Fixed

- **`guardrails.sh` no longer wedges every Bash call.** Two defects on the reported Windows/Git-Bash configuration: (1) `INPUT=$(cat)` read stdin unboundedly — with the upstream TTY bug this blocked (~5s) on every command and prevented the guardrail from running. It now **fails open on an interactive stdin** (`[[ -t 0 ]]`) and bounds a held-open pipe with a backgrounded `cat` + a 1s kill-watchdog — **1s keeps the read comfortably within Claude Code's 5s hook deadline**, and a payload already in the pipe is still captured and enforced. (No GNU `timeout`, Bash 3.2-safe; `read -t` is avoided because Bash 3.2 does not save partial input on its timeout.) (2) The Lean-project ancestor walk terminated only at `"/"`, so a Windows drive-letter path looped forever — Git-Bash reduces `C:/` to `C:`, a non-`/` fixed point (`dirname "C:" == "C:"`) that `"$dir" == "/"` never catches. It now terminates at any root by **fixed point** (`dirname` returns itself). `validate_user_prompt.py` gains the same interactive-stdin guard. New regression tests: idle PTY, held-open empty pipe (bounded), held-open pipe with a complete blocked command (still enforced), closed stdin, and non-`/` fixpoint termination.

## v4.8.0 (August 2026)

Track 3 foundation: `run-contract/v1` — the versioned dispatch + handoff protocol for proving commands and proof-editing agents, plus the rerun guard (Refs #151; closes #73, closes #69, closes #190). Documentation contract, no runtime enforcement, no filesystem persistence (that stays #82).

### Added

- **`references/handoff-contract.md`** — the canonical `run-contract/v1`: a **dispatch** record (parent → worker: `target`, `scope`, `mode`, `capabilities`, `owned_files` + a single `file_baseline` (`file-baseline/v1`), `prior_blocker`, `evidence_delta`, `budget`, and a required typed `context` envelope of pre-collected LSP state) and a **handoff** record (worker → parent/human: `status`, `stop_reason` (incl. `protocol-error`/`operational-error`) + `stop_detail`, the blocker fields non-null iff blocker-driven, `attempted_tools`, `best_candidates`, `failed_avenues`, `evidence` (with `goal_delta`/`diagnostic_delta`), `files_owned` vs `files_changed` + the final `file_baseline`, `next_action`, `new_evidence_required_for_rerun`), each with required fields, enums, and nullability (including nested shapes). It **reuses** existing vocabulary rather than forking it — the cycle engine's `(file, line, error)` blocker signature, the Blocked-Goal Triage `blocker_class`, and the shipped review stuck-mode `next_action` enum. The **rerun guard** is stated once here: don't relaunch the same `(target, scope, mode)` on the same `blocker_signature` without an auditable evidence delta (changed goal/diagnostic, advanced baseline, newly verified candidate, changed source, or new capability) — otherwise route to `review --mode=stuck`, `formalize`, or human handoff. "Durable" = serializable/transferable across subagent, inline, and human handoffs; filesystem persistence is deferred to #82.

### Changed

- **`cycle-engine.md`** gains a **Run Contract (`run-contract/v1`)** section: the parent/worker/human roles, delegation expectations, a **no-subagent fallback** (the contract binds the logical roles, so a host without subagents runs the same records inline), human-in-the-loop handoff, and a shared **Delegation Execution Policy** (generalized from golf's local policy). The existing Pre-flight Context block is now labeled as the concrete dispatch record.
- **`prove.md`** / **`autoprove.md`** — the stop/stuck-boundary summary is the handoff record; both state the rerun guard. **`golf.md`** references the shared delegation policy instead of only its own. **`subagent-workflows.md`** / **`agent-workflows.md`** get a host-neutral core (they are the Claude Code instantiation of the contract). **`SKILL.md`** links the handoff contract and the rerun rule.
- The four proof-editing **agents** (`sorry-filler-deep`, `proof-repair`, `proof-golfer`, `axiom-eliminator`) consume the JSON dispatch and emit a complete handoff: the editing agents fail-closed on the `owned_files` field (not the old `### Owned files` heading, which a JSON dispatch lacks — closing a real custody-bypass gap), and proof-repair returns its diff in the handoff's `artifacts` (`kind: unified-diff`) instead of a bare diff. The dispatch gains `worker` + a typed `parameters` payload; the handoff echoes `target`/`scope`/`mode` (self-identifying for the rerun guard's `same_task`), splits `blocker_kind` (proof / false-statement / safety-guard / capability / protocol / operational) from the proof-only `blocker_class`, and adds `artifacts`.
- Contract Check 38 pins both records' exact field sets, the reused vocabulary, `files_owned` ≠ `files_changed`, the `same_task` + non-null rerun predicate, the operational-error rerun branch, the #82 deferral, the cycle-engine + consumer + **agent** wiring, and a valid dispatch instance; `tests/test_run_contract.py` structurally validates dispatch/handoff fixtures (including a proof-repair diff artifact) so "valid record" is machine-checked, not just grepped.

## v4.7.0 (August 2026)

Broaden `/lean4:review` from proof hygiene to the mathlib-review bar — the final Track 2 item (Refs #151; closes #110). The command now consumes the shipped taxonomy (#114) and schema (#115) as a runtime consumer, closes its long-standing command-argument validation gap, and enforces hook/Codex output instead of trusting it.

### Added

- **`bin/lean4-skills-validate-review-output`** + **`lib/scripts/review_validate.py`** — a runtime validator `/lean4:review` runs over every hook/Codex `output/v2` object before merging its findings. It loads the **shipped** schema (never duplicates its fields) and enforces the cross-field invariants JSON Schema cannot express: `total_suggestions == len(suggestions)`, the `by_severity` histogram agrees with the suggestions, and a non-null `error` implies empty `suggestions`. It **never** normalizes or repairs — invalid output is reported and its findings excluded. Exit codes: `0` valid, `2` usage/empty/malformed-JSON, `3` validation failure (structured `error_code` `schema-invalid`/`semantic-invalid` on stdout), `4` operational (unreadable schema). The narrow subset validator is now production code imported by `tests/test_review_schema.py`, so the schema, the validator, and review behavior cannot drift apart.
- **First `command_args` spec for `/lean4:review`** (`lib/command_args/specs/review.py`, registered in `_COVERED_COMMANDS`) — covers every previously-unvalidated flag (`--scope`/`--line`/`--codex`/`--llm`/`--hook`/`--json`/`--mode`) plus `--mathlib-review` / `--no-mathlib-review`. Unknown flags are rejected; every currently-documented invocation still parses. The two gate flags obey a conflict rule evaluated **before** Layer-2 precedence: only flags resolving to `true` participate (explicit `false` ≡ omission), and both `true` is a single startup error.

### Changed

- **`review.md`** splits into **Layer 1** (always-on proof hygiene, unchanged) and a new **Layer 2 mathlib-review bar** with four first-class sections (Documentation, Library Integration, API/Generalization, Attributes & Instances) mapped onto the shipped taxonomy/`category` vocabulary. Layer 2 runs at full strictness only when the work is mathlib-targeted — gated on `project-context/v1` (`repository_kind == mathlib` **or** `contributing_upstream == yes`), with `--mathlib-review`/`--no-mathlib-review` overriding and a **helper-failure → advisory** fail-safe. Advisory findings must be structurally separable from Layer-1 blockers (own heading or `severity: advisory`). Adds an Invocation Contract section + resolved-input reporting.
- **`references/lean4-review-input-schema.json`** gains scope-dependent `if/then` conditionals: `sorry`/`deps` focus requires a non-null `file` and `line`; `file` focus requires a non-null `file` (the `then` branches pin the types, since `required` alone permits nulls).

`/lean4:review`'s Layer-1 output is unchanged; Layer 2 is additive and, outside a mathlib-targeted context, advisory-only. Contract Check 37 pins the parser adoption, gate flags + conflict, output-validator wiring, input conditionals, and Layer-2 activation table.

## v4.6.9 (August 2026)

Versioned review schema — third Track 2 item (Refs #151; closes #115). The review schema becomes genuinely machine-readable and stops disagreeing with itself across three sites.

### Added

- **`references/lean4-review-schema.json`** — the shipped, normative **output** contract (Codex `--output-schema` and hook stdout), a single shared v2 format. OpenAI Structured Outputs constrained: object root, `additionalProperties: false` on every object (including `$defs`), every property `required`, and semantic optionals expressed as nullable types. Suggestion fields: `file`/`line`/`column` (required-but-nullable — a PR-level `metadata` finding has no location), `severity` (`error`/`warning`/**`advisory`**/`hint`, legacy `style` accepted), `category` (the mathlib-review taxonomy vocabulary plus legacy-accepted `sorry`/`axiom`/`style`/`structure`/`naming`/`golf`/`import` — accepted, not normalized), `rule_id` (nullable; the settled `api`/`vacuous-api`/`advisory` triple validates), `message`, `fix` (nullable — external Codex sets `null`). `summary`/`by_severity` and a nullable `error` are fixed-shape.
- **`references/lean4-review-input-schema.json`** — the **input** hook contract (plain Draft-2020-12). Reuses `project-context/v1`'s `repository_kind` (`mathlib`/`other-lean`/`not-lean`/`unknown`) and `contributing_upstream` **verbatim** rather than inventing a classification, and adds `new_files`/`renamed_files`/`deleted_files`/`generated_root_files`. The established v1 core fields are required and typed; the new repo-state fields are optional — a caller migrating to v2 may omit them but must emit `version: "2.0"` and the required core.

### Changed

- **`review-hook-schema.md`** now documents the two JSON files as the normative source (human-readable field tables only, no copied schema); version bumped 1.0 → 2.0. **`review.md`**'s Codex command points `--output-schema` at the installed `"$LEAN4_REFS/lean4-review-schema.json"` (fixing a bare filename that never resolved) and links the shipped file instead of re-inlining a full, divergent schema block.

This changes the serialized hook contract from v1 to v2 (v2 requires `version: "2.0"`, so a v1 payload does not validate); it does **not** change which findings the built-in `/lean4:review` produces or when mathlib-aware behavior activates (that is #110). Only the **category vocabulary** is backward-compatible — every v1 category value remains accepted. `plugins/lean4/tests/test_review_schema.py` (stdlib only) recursively asserts the Structured Outputs shape and that doc examples use canonical enum values — it does **not** run a Draft-2020-12 validator, so a real `codex exec --output-schema` smoke remains a manual pre-merge check. Contract Check 36 pins the file existence, `repository_kind` reuse, installed path, and de-duplication.

## v4.6.8 (August 2026)

Mathlib review taxonomy — second Track 2 item (Refs #151; closes #114, closes #60). A reference file, not a runtime behavior change; it names the vocabulary that the schema (#115) and the broadened `/lean4:review` (#110) will build on.

### Added

- **`references/mathlib-review-taxonomy.md`** — what mathlib reviewers actually ask for, in nine buckets (surface style; **naming & namespace**, promoted to its own bucket; documentation; file placement / import hygiene; API / generalization; attributes / `simp`; instances; generated-file / module-system chores; metadata / process), each with what-reviewers-mean / cheap / annoying fixes and a recent-PR example. Cross-links existing references (`mathlib-style.md`, `simp-reference.md`, `instance-pollution.md`) rather than duplicating; bucket 8 links the **shipped** tooling by durable path — the canonical header template (`mathlib-style.md § 1`), the checkpoint `mk_all` gate (`checkpoint.md`), and module-system troubleshooting (`compilation-errors.md` §16–§19 via `/lean4:diagnose`).
- **Vacuous-API rule (closes #60)** in bucket 5 — flags a *public declaration presenting as substantive API but whose conclusion collapses to `True` or is otherwise vacuous*, scoped **semantically** (not any `True`/`trivial` use, and not `sorry`-scaffolding); delete-or-replace is a *proposed* remedy surfaced as an **advisory** finding, never an automatic edit. Settled mapping `category: api` / `rule_id: vacuous-api` / `severity: advisory`; other buckets carry *illustrative* candidate mappings only — #115 owns the final enums, nothing here freezes the schema.
- Navigational pointers from `SKILL.md`, `commands/review.md`, and `mathlib-guide.md`. The `review.md` pointer states explicitly that this is background material and **does not** change `/lean4:review`'s behavior — deciding when the buckets become emitted findings is #110's job. Contract test Check 35 pins the structure, the vacuous-api rule, the durable links (never `/lean4:doctor`), the schema-deferral, and the three pointers.

## v4.6.7 (August 2026)

Workflow-scoped docstring policy — the first Track 2 (mathlib-aware review) item (Refs #151; closes #54, closes #116). Replaces the single blanket "docstrings are off-limits" rule with three mode-scoped rules, and folds in the specific development-history anti-patterns #54 catalogued.

### Changed

- **`SKILL.md`** — the blanket docstring prohibition becomes a compact **Mode | May do | Boundary** permission matrix. **Rule A** (default for *any* workflow mutating existing declarations — prove, sorry-filler-deep, golf, refactor, any agent editing existing decls) keeps existing docstrings protected, escape hatch being an explicit user request; statement/signature protection is unchanged. **Rule B** (`/lean4:review`) may flag weak/missing docstrings and *propose replacement text*, staying read-only. **Rule C** (`/lean4:draft`, `/lean4:formalize`, `/lean4:autoformalize`) may emit module/declaration docstrings on files or declarations it *newly creates*, without rewriting pre-existing ones. Detailed policy lives in each command doc. The split applies in every project; when an applicable generation workflow selects the mathlib header, Rule C fills its [mathlib-style.md § 1](plugins/lean4/skills/lean4/references/mathlib-style.md) module-docstring slot — Rule C neither selects nor redefines the template.
- **`commands/prove.md`, `review.md`, `draft.md`, `formalize.md`, `autoformalize.md`** — each carries the boundary of its mode (Rule A / B / C), with the three generation commands linked to the canonical template section rather than to historical issue wording.
- **`references/mathlib-style.md`** — "Avoid Development History References" now calls out **"sorry-free"** as the most common instance beside "axiom-free", extends the guidance to section headers (`/-! … -/`), and lists scaffolding comments (`TODO`/`HACK`/`FIXME`/"temporary") as **review triggers, not automatic-deletion rules** (advisory findings under Rule B).

Contract test Check 34 pins the matrix, the per-command boundaries, the canonical-template links, #54's content, and the absence of the old blanket rule. `#60`'s `api`/`vacuous-api` rule is intentionally deferred to #114's taxonomy (not this PR or #115), preserving the taxonomy → schema → review-behavior order.

## v4.6.6 (August 2026)

Checkpoint `mk_all --check` gate — the final Track 1 item (Refs #151; closes #111). `/lean4:checkpoint` now catches stale generated root-import aggregators before its build, but only when work is plausibly aimed at upstream mathlib contribution.

### Added

- **`lean4-skills-checkpoint-mathlib-roots`** (new wrapper + `lib/scripts/checkpoint_mathlib_roots.py`) — stateless, stdlib-only, deterministic: reads the NUL-delimited candidate set (session-touched paths) on stdin and, anchored at the validated `--root`, emits a versioned `checkpoint-mathlib-roots/v1` JSON record of added/deleted `.lean` files under `<root>/Mathlib/` (renames surface as delete + add via `git ... --no-renames`; modifications are ignored; candidate pathspecs are literal via `--literal-pathspecs`; untracked candidates are seen regardless of `status.showUntrackedFiles`; containment compares physical paths so a symlinked root still resolves). Exit 0 = valid (including no changes), 2 = usage, 4 = git/operational failure. Real-git-fixture unit suite covers added/untracked/deleted files, renames (both paths), spaces + newlines in filenames, unrelated-file exclusion, and root-relative anchoring when the Lean project sits below the git repo root.
- **Generated Root Files gate in `/lean4:checkpoint`** — runs before the project build, only when the gate fires. Activation follows the shipped `project-context/v1` decision order (explicit flag true > validated `intent.contributing_upstream`; `yes` gates, `no`/`unknown`/malformed-or-failed helper skips; `mk_all_declared` is never consulted). New `--mathlib-mk-all` / `--no-mathlib-mk-all` flags (a new `command_args` spec — checkpoint had none — registered in `COMMAND_SPECS` and `_COVERED_COMMANDS`, so both get real startup validation with one truthiness-based mutual-exclusion error and explicit-false ≡ omission). **Explicit opt-in never fails open**: when the gate is requested with `--mathlib-mk-all`, inability to locate the root or inspect candidates stops rather than silently skips. When candidates change, `lake exe mk_all --check` runs from the project root with its output preserved verbatim — stale-file output prints the `lake exe mk_all` remediation (matching diagnose §16); any other nonzero says the gate could not complete and never invents filenames. Check-only, no auto-rewrite. The candidate set is defined independently of the git index (staging happens later); the global-check limitation (once activated, `mk_all --check` inspects the whole checkout) is stated honestly.
- **`references/mathlib-guide.md`** note cross-linking the gate; `/lean4:checkpoint` gains the standard Invocation Contract + Resolved Inputs behavior. lint_docs Check 27 now covers checkpoint; checkpoint budget 90→155. The `command_args` parser suite now runs in CI via `unittest discover` (closing a prior silent-coverage gap), alongside the new helper unit test.

## v4.6.5 (August 2026)

Module-system troubleshooting — error-triggered, advisory-only (Refs #151 Track 1; closes #113). Post-module-system errors are emitted by Lean regardless of project, so this guidance keys on error text, not mathlib intent.

### Added

- **`references/compilation-errors.md` §16–§19** — worked entries for the four common module-system failures, quoting the exact error strings (verified against the Lean source and reference so error-paste matching works): §16 ``cannot import non-`module` X from `module` `` distinguishing a genuinely non-module source file (add the `module` header) from a plain-style aggregator (plain `lake exe mk_all` preserves the existing style, so `lake exe mk_all --module` is needed to create **or convert** to a module-style aggregator; import-list staleness is a separate companion problem that does not itself cause the non-module error); §17 module visibility with each signature mapped to its own remedy (``Unknown identifier`` for a private-scope name → public API / same-Lake-package `import all` (allowed only within the package by default, with the `allowImportAll` escape hatch; never on a downstream dependency) / upstream `public`; ``Expected a definition with an exposed body`` → API lemmas or upstream `@[expose]`; the transitional `backward.privateInPublic` warning documented as a signature only, not a recommendation); §18 the two *opposite* meta-phase failures split explicitly — ``not marked `meta` `` (meta code lacks a meta-phase dependency → `meta`/`meta import`; `public meta import` only when reachable from a public metaprogram) vs ``may not access declaration ... marked as `meta` `` (ordinary code using meta-only code — `meta import` is not the fix; the consumer becomes `meta` or uses a non-meta implementation); §19 old-style header in a module-system repo → the shipped mathlib-style.md template (`module`, grouped imports, `public section`) + `lake exe mk_all`. Four Quick Reference Table rows; §15's file-top-order see-also extended with the module-system shape.
- **`/lean4:diagnose` error triage** — a pasted-error input form (`/lean4:diagnose <pasted error>`): unrecognized-mode arguments are treated as diagnostic text and matched against the compilation-errors patterns, with specific module-system patterns taking precedence over the generic `Build fails → lake update && lake clean && lake build` row. New "Module-System Troubleshooting" section maps each error class to its §16–§19 entry; the `lake exe mk_all` remediation string matches what the #111 checkpoint gate will surface. No `shake` recommendation anywhere (retired with the module system); advisory-only — no automated rewrites (Check 32 pins the exact strings, the direction split, the triage precedence, and the no-shake guard).

## v4.6.4 (August 2026)

Mathlib module-system file templates — the first project-context consumer (Refs #151 Track 1; closes #109). Refreshes the mathlib file-header guidance for the post-2025-11-19 module system and gates command-side scaffolding on contribution intent.

### Changed

- **`references/mathlib-style.md`** — the canonical file-header template now shows the module-system shape: copyright block, then `module`, then grouped `public import` (public-API dependencies) / plain `import` (implementation-only) blocks alphabetized within each group with a blank line between them, then the `/-!` module docstring, then a `public section` opening the exported scope — declarations in a `module` are private by default, and `public import` alone does not export them (`@[expose] public section` only when downstream definitional unfolding is intentionally part of the API). Repo-sensitive rule added: after adding or renaming files in mathlib repos, regenerate root-import files with `lake exe mk_all`. The Quick Checklist and Good File Structure example updated to match; copyright wording unchanged.
- **`references/mathlib-guide.md`** — new "New Files and Generated Root Imports" note cross-linking the header template and `mk_all`, and clarifying that the guide's import snippets teach import *selection*, not header visibility.

### Added

- **`--mathlib-template` / `--no-mathlib-template`** on `/lean4:draft` and `/lean4:formalize` (parser-enforced: mutually exclusive, and rejected without `--output=file` where they would be silently inert). Whole-file writes resolve a mathlib template gate: explicit flag wins; otherwise the shared `lean4-skills-project-context` helper runs from the nearest existing parent of the `--out` target (schema-validated `project-context/v1`, reading `intent.contributing_upstream`). `yes` emits the module-system header with declarations in a `public section`; `no` keeps existing generic behavior; `unknown` keeps existing behavior plus a one-line advisory naming the opt-in flag. Helper failure — including a malformed intent record — degrades to `unknown` with source `helper-failure` and never blocks a write; the effective decision and its source are reported in the Resolved Inputs block. Header attribution defaults to the current year + `git config user.name` (user-supplied attribution wins; lookup failure falls back to the placeholder). The gate changes header shape only — never import selection — and the commands do not run `mk_all` themselves (checkpoint enforcement is #111's scope). Contract pinned by a static doc test (Check 31) plus parser goldens for both commands.

## v4.6.3 (August 2026)

Shared mathlib project-context helper (`project-context/v1`) — the Track 1 foundation (Refs #151; closes #174). Detection only: no consumer behavior changes in this release; #109/#113/#111 wire in separately.

### Added

- **`lean4-skills-project-context`** (new wrapper + `lib/scripts/project_context.py`) — stateless, deterministic (no network, no caching, sorted output): emits repository **facts** strictly separated from contribution **intent**. Facts: `repository_kind` (`mathlib | other-lean | not-lean | unknown` — "could not determine" is never a confident boolean), project markers, toolchain, decomposed git state (`available` / `is_repository: true|false|null` / `remote_scan: complete|failed|skipped`), all **effective** fetch and push URLs per remote (as reported by `git remote get-url`) with canonical-mathlib4 matching restricted to the whitelisted HTTPS/SSH/SCP-like transports, no network, and diagnostics-only `mk_all_declared` via table-aware Lake TOML classification (root-scope package name; `[[lean_exe]]`-scoped executables). Intent: `yes | no | unknown` with auditable `source` (`env-override | invalid-env-override | remote-heuristic | default`) — `LEAN4_MATHLIB_INTENT` override, invalid values fall to the non-enforcing `unknown` with a structured `{code, message}` warning, `no` only when kind and a complete remote scan are both confident, and kind alone never implies intent. Exit 0 = context emitted (unknown facts are valid output); 2 usage; 4 operational (nonexistent explicit `--from`).
- **`references/project-context.md`** — the schema, derivation tables, consumer rule for `unknown` ("unknown context must never silently become an enforcement gate"), and failure behavior. Real-Git fixtures (plus one narrow Git shim for failure injection) in CI covering the #174 fixture list.

## v4.6.2 (August 2026)

File baselines at dispatch with drift abort before mutation — #102 phase 1, the roadmap's last Track 0 reliability item. Prompt-contract orchestration with a tested runtime primitive: two agents targeting the same file could both succeed at Edit, the second silently overwriting the first (the Edit tool only catches local-region mismatch, not whole-file drift).

### Added

- **`lean4-skills-file-baseline`** (new wrapper + `lib/scripts/file_baseline.py`) — stateless, versioned (`file-baseline/v1`): `record` captures normalized path identity (realpath), existence state, and exact sha256 per target (never mtime; never consults git — dirty files are valid baselines); `check` recomputes and classifies every entry (`unchanged`/`modified`/`deleted`/`created`/`retargeted`) with distinct exit codes for drift (3) vs operational errors (4) vs bad input (2); `advance` re-records only intentionally changed entries, carrying the rest forward unchanged (its output replaces the current baseline for subsequent checks). Symlink identity is the resolved path: retargeting is drift even with identical bytes; regular-file replacement with identical bytes is not. `--only` subsets reject unknown paths and report what they skipped. Fail-closed input validation: empty records and structurally malformed v1 entries (relative paths, non-boolean existence, hash/size inconsistency, duplicates) are input errors, never a match. Recorded identity is cwd-independent (normalized absolute lexical path + resolved realpath), so a later check or advance from a different working directory can never bind to a same-named decoy; classification precedence is deleted → retargeted → created → both-absent → hash (a deleted symlink reports `deleted`; a dangling symlink retargeted between two missing targets is drift, not a match); operational-error details are preserved in the structured output. Both transport channels are hardened and regression-tested: the baseline JSON travels over a **quoted** stdin heredoc (`<<'EOF'` — the unquoted form expands `$`/backticks/`$(...)` in the payload; an embedded command was empirically confirmed to execute), and path operands to `record`/`advance` are shell-quoted with `--` before positionals (a hostile filename containing spaces, `$HOME`, backticks, and `$(...)` round-trips record→check→advance unexpanded). Unit suite in CI covering every classification and failure mode — including absent-target retargets via parent-symlink or dangling-symlink replacement (both hosts' invocation path covered by a guardrails passthrough probe; wrapper + both transport regressions in the runtime smoke suite).
- **Custody rule + dispatch wiring** (`cycle-engine.md` § File baselines and drift): the pre-flight dispatch block gains a `### File baseline` field computed by the parent immediately before dispatch. A baseline is the last *accepted* content revision in a single-writer chain — editing agents (`sorry-filler-deep`, `proof-golfer`, `axiom-eliminator`) **fail closed**: a valid, nonempty baseline is required before any mutation, only check exit 0 authorizes the next mutating operation, they check before **every mutating tool operation** (all targets first for multi-file operations), advance only what they intentionally changed (stopping if advance itself fails), and on any nonzero exit apply nothing, emit a structured stale-baseline result (`rerun` / `serialize` / `isolation: "worktree"`), and stop — never re-record and retry. The parent owns check-and-advance when applying proof-repair's line-anchored diffs. The check→edit window is documented as check-to-write, not compare-and-swap: ownership serialization and worktree isolation remain the primary defenses; the baseline is the tripwire. Schema designed for later embedding in Track 3's run artifact.

## v4.6.1 (August 2026)

Documentation restructuring: both READMEs become concise front doors, and the guardrail policy gets a single canonical owner. Covers the root-README trim (PR #171, merged unversioned) and the plugin-README trim (PR #172). No runtime changes.

### Changed

- **Root README trimmed 213 → 97 lines** (PR #171): Quick Start first with a four-row install chooser (per-host commands and version floors stay in INSTALLATION.md, where they can't drift on the front page); one workflow table; a five-line shared-cycle summary scoped to the proving workflows; a `Verification` section describing CI without test counts; a qualified MCP pitch. The project-scoped MCP registration variant and subagent-visibility tip moved to INSTALLATION.md's MCP section. The BibTeX block is retained by maintainer decision.
- **Plugin README trimmed 390 → 111 lines** (PR #172): now a command index — the Check 24-aligned command table, the bounded no-command pass, and condensed cycle/guardrails/LSP-first/runtime-discovery summaries. The Quick Start catalog (a duplicate of the command table), per-command sections (owned by `commands/*.md` and `command-examples.md`), parser detail (`command-invocation.md`), runtime env tables, and the directory tree are removed.
- **New `plugins/lean4/GUARDRAILS.md`** — the full guardrail policy (activation scope, three-tier model, override variables, per-op collaboration policies, hard-blocked push variants, destructive-op coverage, one-shot bypass) extracted and reconciled from the plugin README as the sole canonical owner. Lint Check 10 now applies its full expectations to GUARDRAILS.md only; README.md and MIGRATION.md need a link (plus the bypass-not-bootstrap guard) rather than reproducing the complete policy.

## v4.6.0 (August 2026)

Renames `/lean4:doctor` to `/lean4:diagnose`. Based on PR #156 by Adam McKenna; reconciled and shipped in PR #170. Claude Code namespaces plugin commands, so `/doctor` and `/lean4:doctor` never conflicted at execution — but both appear as closely related "doctor" results in slash-command autocomplete, making it easy to select the wrong diagnostic (built-in `/doctor` diagnoses the Claude Code installation; the plugin command diagnoses the Lean/plugin/project environment). Renaming the Lean-specific command removes the discovery ambiguity.

### Breaking

- **`/lean4:doctor` → `/lean4:diagnose`.** `commands/doctor.md` is renamed to `commands/diagnose.md` (frontmatter `name: diagnose`); all modes are unchanged (`/lean4:diagnose`, `env`, `migrate`, `cleanup`). Clean break — no alias is kept, since a visible alias would recreate the autocomplete clutter the rename removes. Scripts, docs, or muscle memory invoking `/lean4:doctor` must switch; see MIGRATION.md.

### Mechanics

- Canonical recovery wording (single-sourced in `lib/scripts/preflight_env.sh`, byte-identical copy in `hooks/bootstrap.sh`) now says `Run /lean4:diagnose env for a full diagnosis.`; `test_preflight_env.sh`/`test_bootstrap_env.sh` assert it, and the Codex recovery block's wording is unchanged (it never referenced the slash command — only its ownership comments moved to `diagnose.md`).
- All active surfaces renamed: root/plugin READMEs, INSTALLATION.md, MIGRATION.md (gains the removal note), SKILL.md tables and workflow vocabulary, `command-examples`/`command-invocation`/`subagent-workflows` references, all three manifest descriptions (Claude plugin, marketplace, Codex plugin), `lint_docs.sh` `KNOWN_COMMANDS` + per-command tables + the `diagnose.md` special-cases, and `test_validate_user_prompt.sh`. Historical CHANGELOG entries keep `doctor` (accurate for the releases they describe).
- **New Check 30 (`test_contracts.sh`)** makes the rename permanent: `diagnose.md` must exist with `name: diagnose` and the `Lean4 Diagnostics` headings, `doctor.md` must not exist, and no active surface may reference `/lean4:doctor` or the old branding. CHANGELOG.md is allowlisted for historical release entries; MIGRATION.md permits only the exact v4.6.0 rename/removal statements (which must both exist).

## v4.5.10 (August 2026)

Native in-place Codex plugin packaging and host adapter (Closes #157; supersedes #89). The canonical `plugins/lean4` tree is installed directly — no mirrored package or generated Codex-specific skills.

### Native Codex plugin

- Adds `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, a thin `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` exposing only `lean4`, and a manifest-selected `hooks/codex-hooks.json` for SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and advisory Bash PreToolUse handling.
- SessionStart covers `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, and `compact`. It injects the installed root and absolute wrapper paths as context; it does not claim persistent `LEAN4_*` variables or PATH mutation, which Codex does not document.
- Shared bootstrap, preflight, doctor, and prompt validation are host-aware. Claude Code keeps its existing `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` persistence contract; native Codex uses `lean4-skills-preflight --codex` and literal absolute wrapper paths.
- Codex hooks require explicit first-run review in `/hooks`. Until trusted, the core skill remains discoverable but plugin bootstrap and guardrail behavior are unavailable. PreToolUse interception is advisory, not a security boundary.

### Validation and release hygiene

- New Bash 3.2-compatible adapter tests cover metadata, lifecycle matching, truthful bootstrap context, absolute-path preflight, Codex-shaped UserPromptSubmit payloads, and PreToolUse exit-2 blocking.
- Release-metadata Check 23 now parses and validates both Claude and Codex manifests/marketplaces and fails on Codex version drift.
- Codex Tier-3 installation, trust, verification, update, and fallback behavior are documented without claiming `/lean4:*` slash-command parity.

## v4.5.9 (August 2026)

Deepened consolidated simp reference — integrates the useful material from PR #47 (Alok Singh), grounded in the Lean community simp/simproc blog series, into the single `simp-reference.md` instead of reviving the pre-#36 file split or adding a standalone skill. Documentation only; no runtime changes.

### Changed

- **`simp-reference.md` rewritten and deepened**: new *Choose the Mechanism* table (`rw` / `simp only` / terminal `simp` / scoped local simp / named custom simp set / `@[simp]` / `dsimproc` / `simproc` / leave-unchanged / hand-off); new *Simp Normal Forms and Rewrite Policy* section (two meanings of normal form — library default set vs invocation-relative — defined against the full simplifier context; canonical vs locally-useful rewrites; evaluator-simproc rule for explicit vs symbolic data; `simpNF` relationship); hygiene reorganized around the "should this be a simp lemma?" gate with a local-first bias; *Simproc Authoring* now covers `dsimproc` vs `simproc`, pre/post placement via `↓`, exact per-phase result semantics (`.done` is a control-flow promise, not a normal-form claim; prefer `.visit` when unsure), and performance discipline ("no unbounded or general-purpose proof search; keep simprocs deterministic, boring, and cheap").
- **Two verified simproc examples** replace the previous `return .none` skeleton: an explicit-data `dsimproc` (with `↓` pre-activation and symbolic decline) and a proof-producing `simproc` (`mkDecideProof`/`mkEqTrue`), both batch-compiled on Lean `v4.32.0`.
- **`grind-tactic.md`** keeps only its grind-specific simproc escalation conditions and links to the authoring section — single ownership of simproc mechanics.
- Fixed: `@[simp?]` was listed as a simp attribute (`simp?` is a tactic).

### Not carried forward from #47

- The standalone `lean4-simp-simprocs` skill, the separate `simp-normal-forms.md` file, the resurrection of `simp-hygiene.md`/`simproc-patterns.md` (consolidated by #36 five days before #47 was opened), the non-compiling placeholder sketch, and the README entries for eight unrelated stacked skills. Alok's original commits are preserved in this PR's history with authorship intact.

## v4.5.8 (July 2026)

Blocked-goal triage folded into the core proof workflow — integrates the useful material from PR #48 (Alok Singh) into the existing owners instead of shipping a second skill. Documentation only; no runtime changes.

### Added

- **`sorry-filling.md` § Blocked-Goal Triage** — the short decision loop for one blocked goal: inspect → classify (seven blocker classes, now the canonical vocabulary) → at most 3 low-cost candidates via `lean_multi_attempt` → search before adding structure → repeated blocker hands off. The "2–3 attempts, then switch strategy" rule is advisory; enforced stuck detection remains owned by `cycle-engine.md`. SKILL.md's bounded no-command pass gains a two-line pointer.
- **`tactics-reference.md` § Suggestion Tactics** — `try?`, `rw?`, and `hint` join the existing `exact?`/`apply?`/`simp?` coverage, with precise availability (`try?`/`rw?` gated on Lean version; `hint` mathlib-only and import-dependent), the warning that `hint` can admit the goal (never proof completion), and the replace-before-final rule.
- **`review.md` stuck-mode template** — adds **Primary blocker class** (triage vocabulary; the listed blockers may span classes), **Evidence** recording all three cycle-engine handoff elements (searches attempted, returned lemmas, `lean_multi_attempt` outcomes), and **Why first** to the human-readable report. The JSON summary schema is unchanged; machine-readable extension is deferred pending the schema work in #115.

### Not carried forward from #48

- The standalone `stuck?` skill and its README inventory entries — "stuck" is a state inside the existing workflow, not a separate activation domain (and the `stuck?` name is invalid under the Agent Skills name grammar). Alok's original commits are preserved in this PR's history with authorship intact.

## v4.5.7 (July 2026)

Wrapper runtime smoke test in CI — the #152 review's explicitly deferred suggestion, converting that PR's one-off manual smoke into a permanent regression gate. The gate caught three real macOS bugs on its very first CI run; their fixes ship here too.

### Fixed (found by the new gate, on macOS runners)

- **`check_axioms_inline.sh` false success on macOS Bash 3.2** — argless runs crashed on the bare `"${POSITIONAL[@]}"` empty-array expansion (a Bash 3.2 + `set -u` quirk fixed in Bash 4.4), and the EXIT trap then overwrote the failure into **exit 0**. Now uses the `"${arr[@]+...}"` guard idiom (already used elsewhere in the same file); the same guard added to the `LEAN_FILES` loop (empty when resolved args contain no `.lean` files). Argless behavior on all platforms is now the intended "No files specified" → exit 1.
- **Disprove scripts: clean Python-version gate (all 5 entry scripts)** — on interpreters older than 3.11 (e.g. macOS's system python3, 3.9), `disprove_method_probe` died with a RuntimeError traceback (the registry gate raised instead of exiting) and `disprove_target_profile`/`_resolve` died with an import-time `TypeError` traceback (PEP 604 runtime union in `command_args/types.py`, which `from __future__ import annotations` cannot defer). Each entry script now gates before any project import: clean actionable stderr message ("set `LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN` to a Python 3.11+ interpreter") and exit 2, `TYPE_CHECKING`-guarded so mypy (`--python-version 3.10`) coverage is unaffected, mirroring `lib/disprove_methods.py`.

### CI

- **New `tests/test_wrapper_runtime.sh`** — executes all 15 `bin/lean4-skills-*` wrappers argless from a non-repository cwd under a scrubbed environment (no `LEAN4_*` vars, minimal PATH), asserting each wrapper's exact expected exit code. Two probes per wrapper: *direct* execution (kernel resolves the shebang; the exec bit is asserted and on the hook) and *bash-compat* (interpreter forced to `$BASH_FOR_COMPAT`, pinning Bash 3.2 coverage). Exit codes alone can false-green (a missing python delegate exits 2, a traceback exits 1 — both "expected" for some wrappers), so outputs matching infrastructure-failure signatures (`Traceback`, `can't open file`, `command not found`, `SyntaxError` — which parse-time errors print *without* a Traceback header — etc.) fail regardless of code. Check 28 (test_contracts.sh) only proves each wrapper's delegation *target exists*; this suite actually runs them. The expected-code table is cross-checked against `bin/` in both directions — adding a wrapper without a table entry (or vice versa) fails the suite.
- Runs on both runners: ubuntu (`wrapper-smoke` job in lint.yml) and macOS Bash 3.2 (bash3-compat.yml step).

## v4.5.6 (July 2026)

Release automation + skill license metadata. Ends the stale-release footgun: GitHub releases were cut by hand and had stalled at v4.4.10 while main shipped v4.5.5, which is why every `gh skill` command in the docs pins `@main`. No runtime changes.

### CI

- **New `release.yml` workflow** — when a version bump lands on main (push trigger scoped to `plugin.json`), creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag + GitHub release with that version's CHANGELOG section as the notes. No versioning logic of its own: the PR-time release-contract gate (below) guarantees plugin.json ↔ marketplace.json ↔ CHANGELOG consistency, so the workflow just reads the version and publishes. Idempotent (already-released versions are successful no-ops), and race-hardened: `concurrency: queue: max` serializes runs without replacing pending ones; existing-tag validation is event-sensitive (`gh release create --target` never retargets an existing tag) — a push run requires the tag to point at its own commit, while dispatch recovery accepts a tag on an earlier main commit iff it's an ancestor of head and that commit's plugin.json carries the exact version, so a correct tag from a failed publish is reusable without retargeting. Release notes are extracted from the CHANGELOG *at the commit the release attaches to* (`target_sha`), not from the checkout — so recovery can't pair an old tag with newer notes — and the release is explicitly marked `--latest`; `workflow_dispatch` covers backfill/recovery (guarded to main); `actions/checkout` is pinned to a full commit SHA with `persist-credentials: false` since the workflow holds `contents: write`.
- **New `release-contract` job in `lint.yml`** — runs the full `lint_docs.sh` and `test_contracts.sh` suites on every PR, plus the `release_notes.sh` regression suite and the release-notes extraction itself. Previously lint_docs was maintainer-run only (CI's bash3 self-tests deliberately ignore its overall exit status), so Check 23's release-metadata sync was convention rather than enforcement — and release.yml depends on it holding for every commit on main. lint.yml also declares explicit `permissions: contents: read`.
- **New `tools/release_notes.sh` + `tests/test_release_notes.sh`** — single source of truth for CHANGELOG section extraction (exactly one exact `## vX.Y.Z` heading, non-empty body), shared by `release.yml`, the release-contract job, and lint_docs Check 23 — whose previous substring grep would have accepted `## v4.5.60` as satisfying 4.5.6, and accepted an empty section. Duplicate headings for the same version are rejected rather than silently concatenated. The fixture-based self-test covers extraction shape, prefix collision, missing/malformed versions, empty sections, and duplicates.

### Skill metadata

- **`license: MIT` in SKILL.md frontmatter** — the one remaining `gh skill publish --dry-run` recommendation (the repo-root LICENSE file already existed; the Agent Skills frontmatter field didn't).

## v4.5.5 (July 2026)

Native Agent Skills metadata and multi-host installation docs (Refs #153). Every major host (Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenCode, Gemini CLI / Antigravity CLI, GitHub Copilot) now discovers Agent Skills natively from `.agents/skills`, so the old per-host adapter instructions (`AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursor/rules`, oh-my-opencode) were stale. No runtime changes.

### Installation tiers (INSTALLATION.md restructure)

- **Three named tiers** replace the "Environment Bootstrap (All Hosts)" opening (which wrongly claimed every host needs the env vars): Tier 1 core-skill-only (host-native installers/copies — no helper runtime, commands, hooks, or subagent definitions), Tier 2 portable checkout + helper runtime, Tier 3 native plugin (Claude Code today; native Codex plugin tracked in #153).
- **New "Portable Checkout + Helper Runtime" section** — one clone + one `~/.agents/skills` symlink + the single canonical env block (host sections link to it; no duplicated exports), with POSIX-shell/Windows/GUI-host portability notes and update/uninstall steps.

### Host sections

- **Codex**: `$skill-installer` quick install (run in chat; `$CODEX_HOME/skills` destination caveat), `$lean4` invocation, `AGENTS.md` demoted to an optional one-line pointer, commented `codex skill add` block removed, links updated to live learn.chatgpt.com docs.
- **Gemini CLI**: `gemini skills install --path … --scope user` / `gemini skills link` replace the `GEMINI.md` instructions, with an availability note (consumer access moved to Antigravity CLI on June 18, 2026) and an Antigravity CLI subsection (global skills at `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/` — outside the portable `~/.agents/skills` link, so it gets its own Tier-2 symlink; Tier-1 via `gh skill install … --agent antigravity-cli --scope user`, gh ≥ 2.96.0).
- **Cursor / Windsurf / OpenCode**: native skills discovery paths and manual invocation (`/lean4`, `@lean4`, `skill` tool) replace project-rules and oh-my-opencode patterns.
- **New GitHub Copilot section**: `gh skill preview/install cameronfreer/lean4-skills lean4@main --agent github-copilot --scope user` (gh ≥ 2.92.0 — first version installing this plugin-directory layout flat; plain `lean4` selector — the namespaced `lean4/lean4` form is preview-only and rejected by `install`; `@main` because installs without it resolve the stale latest GitHub release).
- Root README: Codex quick-install block, portable-checkout lead, per-host one-liners, Copilot compatibility row.

### Skill metadata & standalone integrity

- **New `skills/lean4/agents/openai.yaml`** (generated via skill-creator's `generate_openai_yaml.py`): Codex UI metadata — display name, short description, `$lean4` default prompt. Guarded by new contract Check 29 (key set, quoting, 25–64-char description, `$lean4` in prompt, no redundant `policy:` block).
- **Skill directory is now link-standalone**: all 8 relative Markdown links escaping `skills/lean4/` (command docs, `lib/data/disprove_methods.toml`, lean4-contribute README) converted to canonical repository URLs labeled as live copies; the registry data file is explicitly marked absent from Tier-1 installs. A resolver pass confirms zero remaining relative escapes, so Tier-1 copies ship without broken links.

## v4.5.4 (July 2026)

Completes the wrapper migration that v4.5.3 deferred: `/lean4:disprove` was the last command whose docs invoked scripts via raw `"$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/disprove_*.py"` — the form that expands to `/disprove_*.py` with a confusing root-path error when the bootstrap env is missing (#108's original symptom). Closes #149.

### `bin/` wrappers (disprove runtime)

- 5 new self-locating executables under `plugins/lean4/bin/`, mirroring the existing wrapper template (`PLUGIN_ROOT` via `BASH_SOURCE`, delegate through `${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3}`):
  - `lean4-skills-disprove-artifact-txn` (transactional append / drop-role / rollback — the Phase 3 hot path)
  - `lean4-skills-disprove-emit-artifact` (collision-safe non-transactional writer)
  - `lean4-skills-disprove-method-probe`, `lean4-skills-disprove-target-profile`, `lean4-skills-disprove-target-resolve` (Phase 1 profiling/resolution + method applicability)
- The Python 3.11+ requirement is unchanged — wrappers honor `LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN`, and only the registry-loading path (`disprove_method_probe.py` via `lib/disprove_methods.py`) enforces 3.11.

### Docs

- `commands/disprove.md` and `references/disprove-engine.md`: all 9 raw `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/disprove_*.py` invocations rewritten to bare wrapper names; bare-basename mentions in the Safety sections and the Target Resolution Flow diagram aligned to the wrapper names.
- SKILL.md's curated wrapper list extended with the five disprove wrappers.

### Lint & contracts

- `test_contracts.sh` Check 26 (wrapper→doc coverage) and Check 27 (no stale `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/<wrapped>` forms) now cover the disprove wrappers automatically — Check 27 derives its wrapper→script mapping from each wrapper's delegation line, so future raw-invocation drift in `disprove` docs fails the suite.

## v4.5.3 (July 2026)

Bootstrap now fails honestly and persists the wrapper `PATH`, plus a shared env-preflight so bootstrap and doctor agree on one recovery message. Also folds in six docs/lint/bugfix PRs that landed on `main` after v4.5.2 without their own version bumps.

### Bootstrap env honesty + shared preflight (primary, closes #108)

- **`hooks/bootstrap.sh` stops reporting false success.** It previously printed `Lean4 v4 ready` and exited 0 *unconditionally* — even when `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` was empty so `persist_env` silently wrote nothing, so a failed bootstrap masqueraded as a good one. Now it validates its inputs, persists, re-checks that persistence took effect, and prints `ready` only on the genuine happy path; every degraded path prints a canonical recovery block to stderr instead (warn + exit 0, so a broken bootstrap doesn't disrupt session start while still being loud and actionable).
- **Bootstrap now persists `PATH`** (`export PATH="$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin:$PATH"`, `:$PATH` kept literal, deduped idempotently). This makes reality match `INSTALLATION.md`'s long-standing claim that bootstrap adds `plugins/lean4/bin/` to PATH — the missing PATH export was why the self-locating `lean4-skills-*` wrappers could be off PATH after a partial bootstrap.
- **New `lib/scripts/preflight_env.sh`** — the single source of the env checks and the canonical recovery wording, with `--bootstrap` (validate a SessionStart's inputs) and `--runtime` (diagnose the live session) modes. New `bin/lean4-skills-preflight` wrapper runs it as a manual diagnostic.
- **`/lean4:doctor env`** now runs the preflight for a live diagnosis (resolved without depending on PATH — doctor is exactly where a broken PATH must stay diagnosable) and its troubleshooting rows reproduce the same three canonical recovery steps, so doctor and bootstrap can't drift.
- **Scope note:** the original issue also flagged seven commands doing raw `"$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/foo.py"` invocations; those were already migrated to self-locating wrappers in #117/#130, so this PR narrows to the still-live bootstrap/PATH truthfulness bug. Migrating `disprove.md`'s remaining raw invocations (needs new `disprove_*` wrappers) is a deferred follow-up.
- **Regression coverage:** new `tests/test_bootstrap_env.sh` and `tests/test_preflight_env.sh`, plus the previously-unwired `test_guardrails.sh` and `test_validate_user_prompt.sh` hook suites, are all now run by the `bash3-compat` CI workflow.

### Folded-in PRs (previously merged without version bumps)

Six PRs landed on `main` after the v4.5.2 release without their own CHANGELOG entries (each was scoped "no version bump" at the time). Folded in here so `git log` archeology reads cleanly:

- **#141: `docs(skill): reframe "Never" rules in SKILL.md to lead with imperative + WHY`** — reframed two free-standing `Never X` rules in SKILL.md's Core Principles / File Handling to lead with the imperative and the reasoning, per the `superpowers:writing-skills` guidance, without dropping their operational cues.
- **#142 (closes #61): `docs(insight): module docstrings must come after imports`** — documents that a module docstring (`/-! … -/`) placed before the `import` block yields the misleading `invalid 'import' command` error; adds a `mathlib-style.md § 2 Placement` subheading and a `compilation-errors.md` section + Quick Reference row.
- **#143: `chore(lint-hygiene): renumber duplicate headings, add uniqueness check, clear persistent warnings`** — fixed the pre-existing duplicate `### 9`/`### 10` headings in `compilation-errors.md`, added a `lint_docs.sh` check (8e) for duplicate `### N.` numbering, and cleared the four chronic line-length / host-agnostic lint warnings.
- **#145 (closes #132): `fix(axiom-check): resolve namespaced declarations correctly + refuse zero-coverage green verdict`** — `check_axioms_inline.sh` now walks a namespace/section stack for correct qualified names, recognizes modern Lean 4 `#print axioms` output (incl. primed names and `does not depend on any axioms`), refuses a green verdict on zero/partial coverage, and ships a 30-probe CI'd self-test.
- **#146 (closes #108-adjacent dead-code gaps): `fix(unused-decls): rg mode flagged everything unused; expand decl classes; harden zero-decls paths`** — fixed `unused_declarations.sh`'s rg extraction (a `path:` prefix flagged *every* declaration as unused), expanded the recognized decl keywords, added a zero-coverage heuristic + hard-fail without PCRE grep, and added a 10-probe CI'd self-test.
- **#147: `fix(sorry-analyzer): coverage-aware exit semantics + modifier-aware decl attribution + CI'd Python tests`** — `sorry_analyzer.py` now exits 2 on zero/partial scan coverage (not a silent clean), attributes modifier-prefixed and same-line-`sorry` declarations, and ships a 38-test unit+subprocess suite that (with `test_ordering.py`) is finally run by CI.

## v4.5.2 (June 2026)

Collab-policy redesign so the hook stops fighting Claude Code's native permission UX, plus three folded-in docs/lint hardening PRs that landed on `main` after v4.5.1 without their own version bump.

### `guardrails.sh` collab-policy refactor (primary)

- Adds a new `host` policy mode meaning "exit 0 — defer to Claude Code's native `Bash(...)` permission rule" so ordinary `git push` no longer requires the exit-2 + `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_BYPASS=1` retry dance.
- Splits the single `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_COLLAB_POLICY` knob into three per-op env vars: `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_PUSH_POLICY`, `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_AMEND_POLICY`, `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_PR_CREATE_POLICY`. Each accepts `host` | `ask` | `allow` | `block`; default is `host`.
- **Back-compat preserved:** `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_COLLAB_POLICY` continues to be honored as the fallback for any per-op policy that isn't explicitly set. Users who already configured `COLLAB_POLICY=allow` / `=block` / `=ask` in their settings keep the v4.5.1 semantics on the soft-gate path.
- **Push variants now tier-3 hard-blocked, non-bypassable** (matching `git reset --hard` posture): `--force` / `-f`, `--force-with-lease[=…]`, `--mirror`, `--delete` / `-d`, legacy `<remote> :<ref>` ref-delete syntax. Each emits a distinct BLOCKED message naming the variant. Per-command escape hatch: `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_DISABLE=1 git push --force …`. `--dry-run` and `git stash push` remain exempted from all push gates.
- Recommended pairing in `.claude/settings.local.json`: `"permissions": { "ask": ["Bash(git push *)", "Bash(gh pr create *)", "Bash(git commit --amend *)"] }` — Claude Code's native "ask once, remember" UI then owns the consent, with the hook only intervening on the dangerous variants.
- See [MIGRATION.md § V4.5.1 → V4.5.2](plugins/lean4/MIGRATION.md#v451--v452) for the migration walkthrough.

### Folded-in PRs (previously merged without version bumps)

Three previously-merged PRs landed on `main` after the v4.5.1 release without their own CHANGELOG entries (each was scoped "no version bump" at the time). They're folded into v4.5.2 here so future archeology against `git log` reads cleanly:

- **#137 (closes #136): `docs(skill): teach the omit [Inst] in ordering rule + lint guard`** — the always-loaded `SKILL.md` Type Class Patterns section now teaches that `omit [Inst] in` must appear **before** the declaration docstring (placing it between docstring and `lemma`/`theorem` is a parse error). Plus a new `lint_docs.sh` Check 8a (`check_skill_omit_rule`) regression guard.
- **#138 (closes #135): `lint(docs): Check 8c — Python helpers must use ${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3}`** — new Check 8c in `lint_docs.sh` flags bare `python3 "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/<script>.py"` invocations and requires the `${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3}` prefix so docs respect the operator's Python pin. Fixes 4 stale `compiler-guided-repair.md` invocations and ships `tests/test_lint_docs.sh` (a plant-in-real-tree self-test) wired into the `bash3-compat` CI workflow.
- **#139 (closes #133): `docs(style): mathlib lambda + show conventions checklist + reference sweep`** — `SKILL.md` mathlib style quick-check (use `fun x ↦` for ordinary lambdas, reserve `=>` for `match`/`do` branches and metaprogramming callbacks; prefer `show P by tac` over `show P from by tac`). New `### 9. Style Conventions Generators Often Miss` section in `mathlib-style.md` with concrete ❌/✅ worked examples. ~80-line `fun ... =>` → `↦` sweep across 11 reference files (callback/elaborator contexts intentionally left alone). Plus `lint_docs.sh` Check 8d (`check_mathlib_style_lambda_guidance`) regression guard on the always-loaded checklist surface.

## v4.5.1 (June 2026)

Adds prefixed `bin/` wrappers for model-facing scripts (closes #117). Claude Code's plugin loader appends `plugins/lean4/bin/` to the Bash tool's `PATH`, so wrappers like `lean4-skills-cycle-tracker` resolve as bare commands and become statically allowlistable as `Bash(lean4-skills-cycle-tracker:*)` — eliminating the per-invocation permission prompts that issue #117 reported on every `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/...` call.

### `bin/` wrappers (model-facing, curated)

- 9 new executables under `plugins/lean4/bin/`, each a thin Bash wrapper resolving `PLUGIN_ROOT` via `BASH_SOURCE` and delegating to `lib/scripts/<script>`:
  - `lean4-skills-cycle-tracker` (autoprove hot path — mandatory)
  - `lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer`, `lean4-skills-find-golfable`, `lean4-skills-find-exact-candidates`, `lean4-skills-analyze-let-usage`
  - `lean4-skills-check-axioms-inline`
  - `lean4-skills-find-usages`, `lean4-skills-search-mathlib`, `lean4-skills-smart-search`
- Bootstrap hook adds `plugins/lean4/bin/` to the Bash tool's `PATH` so wrappers resolve bare; non-Claude hosts can mirror via `export PATH="$LEAN4_BIN:$PATH"` (`INSTALLATION.md` documents both).
- Internal helpers (`parse_command_args.py`, `parse_lean_errors.py`, `solver_cascade.py`, test fixtures, etc.) intentionally stay unwrapped — wrappers are a curated public surface, not a CLI for every script.

### Guardrails & lint

- `hooks/guardrails.sh`'s Lean-script stderr-suppression detector recognizes wrapper invocations in all four call forms (bare, `bin/...`, `./bin/...`, full-path).
- `tools/lint_runtime_portability.sh` Check 10 enforces shape on `bin/` contents: only `lean4-skills-*` regular executables, no symlinks, no non-prefixed files. Checks 1–8 (Bash 3.2 portability, exact shebang) extended to scan the wrappers as runtime targets.
- `tools/test_contracts.sh` Check 26 asserts every wrapper is referenced by at least one model-facing doc surface; Check 27 (new) asserts no stale `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/<wrapped-script>` examples remain outside marked compatibility-fallback regions.
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` extends shellcheck scope to `bin/lean4-skills-*`.

### Docs

- Model-facing references (`subagent-workflows`, `axiom-elimination`, `compiler-guided-repair`, `command-examples`, `agent-workflows`) updated to invoke wrappers directly.
- `INSTALLATION.md` rewritten to show wrapper-first usage; legacy `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/...` form kept only for intentionally-unwrapped scripts.
- `commands/doctor.md` lists the `bin/` directory and recommends `command -v lean4-skills-*` as the wrapper-first check.

## v4.5.0 (June 2026)

Add `/lean4:disprove`, an always-interactive command for **certified counterexample search**. It reports `REFUTED` **only** when Lean typechecks a proof of the negation under `lake env lean` (no `sorry`/`admit`) with its axioms inside an explicit whitelist; otherwise `WITNESS_UNCERTIFIED` (candidate found, gate rejected) or `INCONCLUSIVE` (no candidate within budgets). New command (the 7th parameter-heavy command); existing workflows are unaffected. **Requires Python 3.11+** for the method-registry loader (`tomllib`); the rest of the plugin remains 3.10+.

### Command & engine

- `commands/disprove.md` + `skills/lean4/references/disprove-engine.md` (full engine reference, including an Implementation Status table separating deterministic / model-mediated (LSP) / deferred capabilities)
- Reuses the shared 6-phase cycle, specializing Phase 5 as **Accumulate** and Phase 1 with three dynamic, evidence-seeded menus: Step 0 Knowledge Search, Step 1 Method, Step 2 Config

### Deterministic primitives

- `disprove_target_resolve.py` (target classifier) and `disprove_target_profile.py` (deterministic profile envelope: non-authoritative grep resolution, `path_class`/`writable`, fail-fast on a missing `File.lean:LINE` target, read-only-dependency refusal; LSP/kernel fields left for the cycling LLM)
- `disprove_artifact_txn.py` — transactional append / drop-role / rollback keyed by a txn id (revert a cycle's writes as a unit), alongside the companion collision-safe `disprove_emit_artifact.py`
- `disprove_method_probe.py` — deterministic method applicability/availability filter (registry shape vs profile, prerequisite hints, solver-on-PATH advisory for `external`)
- `disprove_methods.toml` + `disprove_methods.py` registry; `cycle_tracker.sh` gains `kw-search-can` / `kw-search` budget actions

### Parser / host integration

- `command_args/specs/disprove.py` + shared `command_args/target_patterns.py`; registered in `specs/__init__.py` and the host-agnostic `UserPromptSubmit` validation (`_COVERED_COMMANDS`)

### Tests & docs

- New/updated suites for the disprove surface (`test_disprove_{emit_artifact,artifact_txn,target_resolve,target_profile,method_probe,methods,flow}`, parser specs, hook round-trip); chmod-based read-only assertions skip under root
- README (root + plugin), SKILL.md, command-examples.md, and cross-references list `disprove` (six → seven parameter-heavy commands). Validated locally with ruff, ruff format --check, and mypy --strict

## v4.4.11 (May 2026)

Three-tier git-op policy. Path-scoped `git checkout` / `git restore` operations move from absolute hard-block to a new policy-controlled soft-gate; whole-worktree and force-branch-switch destructive ops remain absolute. No new commands or workflow changes; default behavior is backward-compatible.

### Guardrail tiers (`plugins/lean4/hooks/guardrails.sh`)

- Add `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_DESTRUCTIVE_POLICY` (`ask` default, `allow`, `block`) covering path-scoped `git checkout` / `git restore` forms — independent of the existing `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_COLLAB_POLICY` (#131)
- `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_BYPASS=1` one-shot prefix applies to either soft-gate category
- Whole-worktree variants (`git checkout .` / `./` / `:/` / `HEAD -- .`, `git restore .` / `--staged --worktree`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -f`) stay absolute hard-block; pure unstaging (`git restore --staged <path>`) stays implicit-allow
- Force-branch checkout/switch (`git checkout -f|--force <branch-or-ref>`, `git switch -f|--force|--discard-changes`) hard-block; option ordering and ref shorthand (`@{-1}`, `-`, `@`, `HEAD~3`, `HEAD@{1}`) all covered
- `--pathspec-from-file=…` hard-blocks for both checkout and restore (opaque paths file the guardrail can't inspect); `--staged --pathspec-from-file=…` stays allowed
- Path-scoped soft-gate covers `<tree-ish> <path>`, `--ours` / `--theirs` / `-2` / `-3` / `--merge` / `--conflict=<style>`, `-f <path-like>`, `./<path>` / `:/<path>` / `../<path>` (incl. dotfiles), `--ignore-skip-worktree-bits` / `--no-overlay` / `--overlay` / `--recurse-submodules`, `-p` / `--patch`, all with non-destructive flag prefix/interleaving

### Tests

- `test_guardrails.sh` grows from 75 to 251 probes; new tier-boundary coverage for the forms above, including empirical temp-repo verification of which checkout/switch shapes actually discard a dirty worktree (audit posted as a PR comment)

### Docs

- `plugins/lean4/README.md` and `plugins/lean4/MIGRATION.md` document the three-tier model, the new env var, the bypass token's scope, and the path-scoped vs whole-worktree distinction

## v4.4.10 (May 2026)

Portability hardening, lint/CI infrastructure, and a broad code-quality sweep. No new commands or user-facing behavior changes.

### Portability

- Replace `#!/bin/bash` with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` in runtime scripts so the plugin works on NixOS / minimal containers where `/bin/bash` doesn't exist (#118, FernandoChu)
- Replace hardcoded `/tmp` with `$TMPDIR` in `cycle_tracker.sh` for macOS / sandboxed-runtime correctness (#112)
- Document `bash` on `PATH` as an explicit requirement (#127)

### Lint / CI infrastructure

- Add Bash 3.2 compatibility lint for macOS (#107) — later expanded and renamed to `lint_runtime_portability.sh` (this release)
- Harden shebang policy: exact `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for runtime `.sh`, exact `#!/usr/bin/env python3` for shebanged runtime `.py`, no `plugins/lean4/bin` shortcut bypassing guardrails (#121, #123)
- Parameterize self-test via `BASH_FOR_COMPAT` so it skips gracefully on `/bin/bash`-less hosts (#121)
- Add `lint` workflow with ruff (`E,F,W,B,C4,UP,SIM,I,RUF,N`), `ruff format --check`, mypy `--strict`, and shellcheck (#124, #126)
- Pin tool versions for deterministic CI: ruff 0.15.13, mypy 1.20.2, shellcheck 0.10.0 (#125, #126)
- Bump GitHub Actions to Node 24 (`checkout@v5`, `setup-python@v6`) ahead of the 2026-06-02 default switch (#126)
- Tighten `bash3-compat.yml` to hard-assert `/bin/bash` is exactly Bash 3.2 (#121)
- Rename `lint_bash_compat.sh` → `lint_runtime_portability.sh` to reflect its expanded scope (this release)

### Code cleanup

- Ruff / mypy / shellcheck sweep across `plugins/lean4/` Python and shell — type annotations, modern PEP-585/604 syntax, sorted `__all__`, quoted parameter expansions, dead-store removal, BSD-compatible `find -print0 | xargs -0` (#120, Holger Dell)
- Normalize executable-script module docstrings to BLOCK form (`"""` on its own line) for a single repo convention (#122)
- `print(__doc__)` callers use `.lstrip()` to avoid a leading blank line; `parse_command_args.py --help` now exits 0 to stdout instead of 1 to stderr (#127)
- `lint_docs.sh` always derives `PLUGIN_ROOT` from `BASH_SOURCE` (no longer false-positives a Bash 3.2 failure when the harness cache is stale) (#127)

## v4.4.9 (April 2026)

- Add shared slash-command parser and `UserPromptSubmit` hook for pre-validation of the six parameter-heavy commands (#103, #106) — Phase 3 of the command invocation fix
- Honest invocation contract + `cycle_tracker.sh` session tracker for explicit stop budgets (#105) — Phase 1–2 of the command invocation fix
- Warn about OOM from large dependent type signatures (#104)
- Fix Bash 3.2 compatibility: replace `${suffix,,}` with portable `tr` lowercase in `cycle_tracker.sh` (macOS stock bash)

## v4.4.8 (April 2026)

- Document one-concurrent-editor-per-file rule for proof agents (#64)
- Exclusive file ownership rule in canonical subagent dispatch block
- `isolation: "worktree"` recommended for background file-editing agents
- Relabel axiom checker as best-effort; surface coverage limits and mutation warning (#92)
- Warn that `lake build` progress counter `[N/M]` has a growing denominator (#84)

## v4.4.7 (March 2026)

- Use fully-qualified `mcp__lean-lsp__` tool names in agent frontmatter (#81, TheDarkchip) — may improve MCP availability in subagents on some Claude Code configurations
- Lint now enforces `mcp__lean-lsp__` prefixed MCP tool names in agent `tools:` frontmatter

## v4.4.6 (March 2026)

- Add compiler-internals and FFI-interop reference files from PR #24 content (Alok Singh)
- Subagent no-MCP hygiene: agents no longer invoke MCP tool names via Bash or write scripts/temp files to read source (#39, #90)
- Pre-flight MCP context dispatch: parent thread packs goal, diagnostics, and search results into subagent prompts (#90)
- Update subagent-workflows.md: rewrite MCP integration hierarchy, fix upstream tracking link to anthropics/claude-code#39962
- Add capability checklist and operating profiles (`full`, `mcp_main_only`, `scripts_only`, `review_only`) to SKILL.md (#72)

## v4.4.5 (March 2026)

- Promote 100-char line width rule to SKILL.md active editing contract (#58)
- Add metaprogramming line-width examples to mathlib-style.md (#58)
- Add 100-char constraint to generation/edit commands, proof-editing agents, and sorry-filling reference (#58)
- Teach review to flag unnecessary sub-100-char wrapping (#58)

## v4.4.4 (March 2026)

- Stop recommending `git stash` in guardrails and docs — commit or checkpoint first (#66)
- Add multi-branch worktree workflow guidance to subagent-workflows.md (#66)
- Fix bare-slash-link lint rule so mixed good/bad-link lines are still reported

## v4.4.3 (March 2026)

- Add per-agent MCP availability canary to all proof-editing agents (#39)
- Document upstream MCP-in-subagents limitation (anthropic/claude-code#13605)
- Recommend user-scoped lean-lsp for subagent reliability
- Soften axiom-eliminator "Generalize" → "Refactor to use" to reduce terminology drift
- Fix MCP scope labels and syntax: use `--scope user` for cross-project visibility, `--transport stdio`, `--` separator

## v4.4.2 (March 2026)

- Surface `lean_code_actions` across all skill, command, agent, and reference docs (#70)
- Tighten `lean_multi_attempt` success interpretation: empty goals alone is not proof success
- Budget `lean_run_code` in SKILL.md: isolated probes only, not a substitute for live inspection
- Make `lean_goal` explicit as first step in sorry-filling Core Workflow
- Add `lean_diagnostic_messages` → `lean_code_actions` ladder to LSP-first requirement

## v4.4.1 (March 2026)

- BREAKING: Rename proof-editing agents to drop `lean4-` prefix (#67)
  - `lean4-sorry-filler-deep` → `sorry-filler-deep`
  - `lean4-proof-repair` → `proof-repair`
  - `lean4-proof-golfer` → `proof-golfer`
  - `lean4-axiom-eliminator` → `axiom-eliminator`

## v4.4.0 (March 2026)

Separates drafting from proving with a cleaner command surface. Existing invocations
continue to work; see MIGRATION.md for the full compatibility story.

- NEW `/lean4:draft`: skeleton-only drafting (default `--mode=skeleton`); `--mode=attempt` recovers old formalize proof-attempt behavior
- REWRITE `/lean4:formalize`: syntax-compatible with old formalize, but now broader — runs interactive synthesis (draft + prove); users wanting the old lighter drafting path should use `/lean4:draft`
- NEW `/lean4:autoformalize`: autonomous synthesis (draft + autoprove); preferred over `autoprove --formalize=auto`
- TIGHTENED `/lean4:prove` and `/lean4:autoprove`: declaration headers are now immutable (header fence); deep mode emits `next_action = redraft` instead of modifying statements
- DEPRECATED `autoprove --formalize=*` flags: still functional, recommend `/lean4:autoformalize`
- Cycle-engine: "Formalize Outer Loop" → "Synthesis Outer Loop"
- Router action `formalize-restage` → `redraft`; commit prefix `formalize:` → `draft:`

## v4.3.3 (March 2026)
- Align golf scripts and docs with lexicographic scoring policy (directness → inference burden → perf → length)
- `find_golfable.py`: add `benefit` field, reorder patterns to policy order, phase-ordered CLI output
- Golfer agent: fix exact-collapse acceptance rule to reference scoring order
- `proof-golfing-patterns.md`: move conditional patterns (rwa, simpa) out of High-Priority section
- `proof-golfing.md`: reorder Phase 1 search commands to policy order
- Surface `find_exact_candidates.py` as optional companion in golf.md, agent, and scripts README
- `lint_docs.sh`: add drift checks for stale "HIGHEST value" and "net decrease" language; explicit `max_lines` for all commands
- New `tests/test_ordering.py` for deterministic benefit-based sort validation
- Align agent files with official Claude Code conventions (#2f8293f)
- `/lean4:learn`: add pedagogical self-debate step to iterate loop (#43)
- `lint_docs.sh`: expand version lint to full release-metadata consistency check (#50)
- Add cold-start / fresh-worktree build-order guidance (#49)
- Replace deprecated `induction'` with structured induction syntax (#46)
- Normalize WRONG/CORRECT labels in compilation-errors.md

## v4.3.2 (March 2026)
- New [`/lean4:refactor`](plugins/lean4/commands/refactor.md) command: strategy-level proof simplification (mathlib leverage, helper extraction, congr/EqOn patterns)
- New [proof-simplification.md](plugins/lean4/skills/lean4/references/proof-simplification.md) reference guide (congr/EqOn patterns, generalization checklist, file-level audit)
- Expanded [grind-tactic.md](plugins/lean4/skills/lean4/references/grind-tactic.md): `@[grind]` attribute variants, `grind_pattern` constraint syntax, `+suggestions`/`+locals` workflow, interactive debugging loop, simproc escalation, anti-patterns (PR #19)
- Content adapted from PR #27 (Vasily Ilin) refactor command, with reference compression

## v4.3.1 (March 2026)
- New [`json-patterns`](plugins/lean4/skills/lean4/references/json-patterns.md) reference: `json%` elaboration syntax, `ToJson` derivation, `Json.mkObj` for dynamic keys, `Json.mergeObj` for skeleton+dynamic, failure modes
- Write-focused scope (no `FromJson`/parsing); linked from SKILL.md **Custom Syntax** section
- Content adapted from PR #20 (Alok Singh) standalone skill, converted to reference file

## v4.3.0 (March 2026)
- Formalize-aware outer loop for [`/lean4:autoprove`](plugins/lean4/commands/autoprove.md): opt-in `--formalize=auto|restage` wraps the inner cycle with source-backed statement acquisition and review-driven routing
- New flags: `--formalize`, `--source`, `--claim-select`, `--formalize-rigor`, `--statement-policy`, `--formalize-out`
- `--statement-policy` defaults to `rewrite-generated-only` when formalize is active (autonomous restage)
- `/lean4:review --mode=stuck` emits machine-readable `next_action` routing field
- Default behavior (`--formalize=never`) unchanged

## v4.2.0 (March 2026)
- New [`/lean4:formalize`](plugins/lean4/commands/formalize.md) command: turn informal math into Lean statements
- Split from `/lean4:learn --mode=formalize` — formalize is now a standalone command
- `/lean4:learn` refocused on interactive teaching and mathlib exploration
- `learn-pathways.md` updated to be command-agnostic (shared by learn and formalize)

## v4.1.0 (February 2026)
- New [`/lean4:learn`](plugins/lean4/commands/learn.md) command: interactive teaching, mathlib exploration, autoformalization
- Two-layer architecture: Lean-backed verification (always runs) + presentation layer (informal/supporting/formal)
- Intent classification (`--intent`), game-style tracks (`--style=game`), source handling (`--source`)
- Verification status model with `--verify=best-effort|strict`

## v4.0.9 (February 2026)
- Integrated advanced references from PR #10 (Alok Singh): grind tactic, simprocs, metaprogramming, linters, FFI, verso-docs, profiling
- All new content is reference-only, outside default prove/autoprove loop
- Lint guards for scope guards, SKILL.md cross-references, stale plugin paths, and command frontmatter

## v4.0.8 (February 2026)
- Three-tier build verification policy (diagnostics → `lake env lean` → `lake build`)
- Fixed incorrect `lake build FILE.lean` patterns across references
- Lint check prevents `lake build` with file arguments from regressing

## v4.0.7 (February 2026)
- Custom syntax reference: notations, macros, elaborators, DSLs (from PR #5, Alok Singh)
- DSL scaffold template with precedence-correct examples
- Version-compat note for MetaM/TacticM API drift across toolchains

## v4.0.5 (February 2026)
- Split `/lean4:autoprover` into `/lean4:prove` (guided) and `/lean4:autoprove` (autonomous)
- prove: asks before each cycle, startup questionnaire, interactive deep approval
- autoprove: autonomous loop with hard stop rules, structured summary on stop
- Shared cycle engine: plan → work → checkpoint → review → replan → continue/stop
- Stuck definition uses exact signature hashing for precision
- Checkpoint skips commit on empty diff

## v4.0.0 (February 2026)
- Unified into single `lean4` plugin
- New `/lean4:autoprover` - planning-first workflow
- New `/lean4:golf` - standalone proof optimization
