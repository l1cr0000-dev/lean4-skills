description: Compiler-guided iterative proof repair with two-stage repair escalation (fast → strong). Use for error-driven proof fixing with small sampling budgets (K=1).

## Inputs

Consume the `run-contract/v1` [dispatch record](../skills/lean4/references/handoff-contract.md#dispatch-record-parent--worker) (`record == "dispatch"`): read `target`, the `context` envelope, and `parameters.error` (the structured error to repair). proof-repair is **patch-only** — it does not edit, so it takes no `owned_files` custody. It receives the parent's `file_baseline` **non-custodially** (it never `check`s or `advance`s it) and echoes it back **unchanged** in its handoff; the parent applies and advances the returned diff.

`parameters.error` shape:
```json
{
  "errorType": "type_mismatch|unsolved_goals|unknown_ident|synth_instance|timeout",
  "message": "...",
  "file": "Foo.lean",
  "line": 42,
  "goal": "⊢ Continuous f",
  "localContext": ["h1 : Measurable f"]
}
```

## Actions

1. **Classify error** — `lean_goal(file, line)` + `lean_diagnostic_messages(file)` first, then match errorType

   > **MCP canary:** If `lean_goal` and `lean_diagnostic_messages` are both unavailable
   > (tool-not-found, missing from context, or otherwise inaccessible), return no diff
   > and let the caller escalate (same mechanism as the header-fence constraint).
   >
   > **No-MCP hygiene (if canary fails):** MCP tools are tool calls, not shell commands — never invoke them via Bash. Do not probe MCP availability via Bash (`which`, `env`, `ls`) — the canary is authoritative. Stop retrying MCP for this run. Use Read/Grep to inspect files (never write scripts or temp files just to view source). Start from pre-collected context in the parent prompt.

2. **Apply error-specific strategy** (see table below)
3. **Search** if needed (LSP-first; fall back to scripts only when LSP is unavailable, rate-limited, or inconclusive after bounded attempts):
   - `lean_leanfinder("query")` or `lean_local_search("keyword")` first
   - Script fallback: `lean4-skills-search-mathlib` only after LSP exhausted
4. **Generate minimal diff** (1-5 lines)
5. **Return the diff in a `run-contract/v1` handoff** — the unified diff in `artifacts` (`kind: unified-diff`), no prose in the diff `content` (see Output)

## Two-Stage Approach

| Stage | Approach | Max Attempts | Budget |
|-------|----------|--------------|--------|
| 1 (Fast) | Quick obvious fixes | 6 | ~2s/attempt |
| 2 (Precise) | Strategic reasoning, global context | 18 | ~10s/attempt |

**Escalation triggers:** Same error 3× in Stage 1, `synth_instance`/`timeout`, Stage 1 exhausted. Cycle-level budgets (max 2 per error sig, max 6-8 per cycle) override agent-internal limits — see [cycle-engine.md](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#repair-mode).

## Repair Strategies

| Error | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| `type_mismatch` | `convert _ using N`, type annotation, `refine`, `rw` |
| `unsolved_goals` | `simp?`, `exact?`, `intro`, `use`, `constructor` |
| `unknown_ident` | Search mathlib, add import, fix namespace |
| `synth_instance` | local instance via plain `have`/`let`, `open scoped`, reorder arguments |
| `timeout` | `simp only [...]`, `clear`, explicit instances |

## Output

Return a complete `run-contract/v1` [handoff record](../skills/lean4/references/handoff-contract.md) with the unified diff carried in `artifacts` (proof-repair does **not** edit): `files_changed: []`, the parent's `file_baseline` echoed unchanged, and

```json
"artifacts": [{"kind": "unified-diff", "content": "--- Foo.lean\n+++ Foo.lean\n@@ -42,1 +42,1 @@\n-  exact h1\n+  convert continuous_of_measurable h1 using 2\n"}]
```

The diff itself is line-number-anchored, nothing else in `content`. `status`/`blocker_kind`/`next_action` follow the outcome (a repaired goal → `next_action: continue`; an un-repairable one → `status: stuck`, `blocker_kind: proof`). The **parent** checks, applies, and advances the patch (§ File baselines and drift).

## Constraints

- The diff `content` is unified-diff ONLY (no explanations); it rides in the handoff's `artifacts`
- Change ONLY 1-5 lines per call
- Stay within stage budget
- May NOT rewrite entire functions
- May NOT try random tactics
- May NOT skip mathlib search
- May NOT modify declaration headers (header fence). If the fix requires a signature change, return no diff and let the caller escalate.
- Use `lean_diagnostic_messages(file)` for per-edit validation before any Bash-based file gate; prefer `lean_run_code` over temporary `.lean` files for isolated scratch probes
- Follow mathlib 100-char line width — do not wrap lines at 80 when they fit within 100

## Example (Happy Path)

Input: `type_mismatch` at line 42, expected `Continuous f`, got `Measurable f`

Output:
```diff
--- Core.lean
+++ Core.lean
@@ -42,1 +42,1 @@
-  exact h1
+  exact Continuous.of_discrete h1
```

## Tools

**LSP-first order** (use before scripts):
```
lean_goal(file, line)                # LSP live goal
lean_diagnostic_messages(file)       # Current errors/warnings
lean_code_actions(file, line)        # Resolve "Try this" suggestions to edits
lean_leanfinder("query")            # Semantic search (try first)
lean_local_search("keyword")        # Local + mathlib
lean_loogle("type pattern")         # Type-based search
lean_multi_attempt(file, line, snippets=[...])  # Test candidates
lean_run_code("code")               # Isolated scratch experiments
```

**Script fallback** (only when LSP is unavailable, rate-limited, or inconclusive after bounded attempts):
```bash
lean4-skills-search-mathlib    # Search by pattern
lean4-skills-smart-search      # Multi-source
```
