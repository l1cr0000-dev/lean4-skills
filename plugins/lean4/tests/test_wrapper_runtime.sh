# Runtime smoke test for the bin/lean4-skills-* wrappers — the gate
# Check 28 (test_contracts.sh) deliberately stops short of: Check 28
# proves each wrapper's delegation *target exists*, this suite actually
# EXECUTES every wrapper and asserts its exact exit code. Converts the
# one-off manual smoke from PR #152 review into a permanent gate.
#
# Execution conditions are the hostile ones wrappers are designed for
# (#108/#148): argless, from a non-repository cwd, under a scrubbed
# environment with no LEAN4_* vars — so results are identical on dev
# machines (where the session bootstrap exports them; preflight would
# exit 0 there) and CI runners (where it exits 2).
#
# Expected codes are the wrappers' argless contract today:
#   2  argparse/usage errors and env-diagnosis failures
#   1  script-level "no input specified" errors
# A mismatch means a wrapper's argless behavior changed (update the
# table deliberately) — or, for 126/127, that the wrapper failed to
# exec its delegate at all (broken shebang, missing target, python3
# not found), which is exactly the regression class this suite exists
# to catch; those get a distinct message.
#
# Each wrapper gets two probes:
#   direct       — executes the wrapper itself, so the kernel resolves
#                  the shebang and the executable bit is on the hook;
#                  this is the probe that actually catches a broken
#                  shebang or a lost +x (as 126/127).
#   bash-compat  — forces $BASH_FOR_COMPAT (default /bin/bash) as the
#                  interpreter, pinning Bash 3.2 coverage in the macOS
#                  bash3-compat job regardless of how the scrubbed PATH
#                  resolves `env bash` (ubuntu's wrapper-smoke job runs
#                  the same probes under Bash 5).
# On hosts without /bin/bash the test SKIPs gracefully.
